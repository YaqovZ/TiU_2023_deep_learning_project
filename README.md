# Deep Learning Project: Skin Lesion Classification

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive application of deep learning techniques for the classification of skin lesions. It was part of the Deep Learning course focusing on different aspects of the challenge.

## Project Description
The primary objective was to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying various types of skin lesions using dermatoscopic images. The project involved:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Development of a Baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
- Experimentation with advanced techniques like Transfer Learning using architectures like VGG16, ResNet50, or DenseNet
- Performance optimization through hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score

## Dataset
The dataset used was the Skin Cancer dataset by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). It contains dermatoscopic images of various skin lesions, including Melanoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, and others.
